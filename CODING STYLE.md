When commiting to this repo, you should follow set of some guidelines of coding style:
* Use 'm' as prefix for private class members
* Public class members go first, then private members and then protected ones.
* All method and field names (except const. and '#define's) use 'camelCase' naming style, examples:
    * mHealth
    * setHealth(int newHealth)
    * getHealth()
    * addHealth()
    etc.
